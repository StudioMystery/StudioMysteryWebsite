This year, the gaming industry continues to face a number of challenges:

1. Big budget, AAA games are bombing with core audiences. (Dragon Age, Star Wars Outlaws, Golum, Call of Duty, and Starfield.)
2. Microtransactions continue to shatter immersion and prey on consumers.
3. Corporate interferance (risk avoidance) diminishes creativity.

But overall, I think these issues all stem from the same root problem. If you work in gaming, your north star should be “fun.”

If you are making decisions based on ego, or the bottom line, you’re going to eventually run afoul of your consumer.

If the vast majority of players don’t like your decisions, or just don’t want the content, you are not adding latent value, you are subtracting it.

I believe there is real friction when a player looks through a cosmetic store, at all the content they’ll never use, blatantly aware that the company behind the game is manipulating them.

This erodes the one thing your game is supposed to do: provide enjoyment.

Thankfully, the solution is simple. Focus on the consumers needs.
