## Why Bother?

In a synthetic age, I believe the most human thing we can do is to tell stories. Studio Mystery exists to foster and produce those stories, to keep us excited, entertained, and fulfilled. That is the mission of the company.

This blog will be a tool to support that mission: I plan to post plenty of fiction here, in chapter-length installments, as well as my thoughts on craft and design.

Some of my thoughts on engineering and code may also wind up here too. All art is political, but not necesarily partisan, so I will try to keep my soapboxing somewhere else.

Above all, I hope that what I produce brings value to you, my dear reader.
