## Where I've Been

First off, let me update you on my current projects:

My scifi mech novel, _SoftWar - Predator, Prey_ is my current focus. I've completely finished the first 13 chapter draft, but my wife has given me some incredibly valueable feedback (aka the main character sucks) and she's 100% right. So I'm four chapters into the rewrite and it's getting better. I'm excited to see this new version of Yuri survive Rocco-II and fight off the Zard hacker.

My long-running top-down pixel-art RPG is pretty stagnate, despite my recent efforts. First, I got half-way through a major refactor. I have entire gamemodes of features to re-implement. Next, I tried to upgrade from Godot 3.5 to 4.1 and got hit with thousands of confusing issues (why is my \_ready() func triggering _earlier_ now?) So of course I reverted those changes and decided 3.5 is what I'm sticking with. Ugh. This project is in indie-dev hell.

Last off, new responsibilities at work and home have eaten into my availability to work on these personal projects and produce commentary for this blog, BUT I'M NOT QUITTING YET. Maybe next week. But not today!
